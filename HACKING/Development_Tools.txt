===== Working with Bazaar =====
The zim code is kept under version control using the bazaar version control system. See the website for documentation on using this system: http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/

The quick course, to get a copy of the zim code:

	'''
	bzr branch lp:zim
	'''

To check in some changes (don't forget to give some meaningful changelog)

	'''
	bzr add
	bzr commit 
	'''


To create a patch that can be mailed:

	'''
	bzr send -o some-description.patch
	'''

Alternatively you can publish your branch directly on the launchpad website and file a merge proposal.

===== Development scripts =====
When you are working with the development code check the folder "''./tools/''" for some useful scripts.
